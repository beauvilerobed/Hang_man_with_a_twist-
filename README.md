# Hang man with a twist!

In this version of the classic game you will get to choose the number of attempts for each leter. That number corresponds to the number of attempts you have for **EACH** letter of a given word.

**RULE1**: 

If you repeat a letter that is not the correct letter(e.g. r r) then that is an attempt.


**RULE2**: 

If you repeat a letter more than three times or you have you two non-consecutive letters which were already used
       (e.g.  a b b b  or  k b e d c k   ) then GAME OVER.
      
Also, there is a *hint mode* and a *non-hint mode* in case you're feeling good!
       
   The guessing starts when you pick a letter.
              ## Good luck!
