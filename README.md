# Hang_man_with_a_twist!

In this version of the classic game you will have a chosen number of tries to each letter of a given random word.

RULE1: If you repeat a letter that is not the correct letter(e.g. r r) then that is an attempt.
RULE2: If you repeat a letter more than three times or have you two non-consecutive letters which were already used
       (e.g.  a b b b  or  a b e d c a   ) then GAME OVER.
       
       The guessing starts when you pick a letter.
       
        Good luck!
